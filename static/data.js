The plan includes key reductions that pay big returns and big impact. It sets a framework for future enrollment growth for a thriving MSUM campus. The plan focusses on the Future of Learning, The Business of Education, Resilient Carbon Neutral Facilities built on a foundation of equitable and inclusive learning. Four strategies in the plan: 1. Culture of Connecting, Best Business Case, Carbon Neutrality, Honoring Heritage and Technology of Tomorrow. I was pleased to host this public open house with Jean Hollaar, the MSUM Vice President of Finance & Administration and Brenda Norris, MSUM AVP Facilities Director.
